1.On github navigate to YOUR fork of the spoon-knife repo
2.Under your repo name, click "clone or download" and copy the clone URL
3.Open terminal
4.Type "git clone" and paste the URL and press enter, your local clone will be created
5.Now you have a local copy of your fork of the spoon-knife repo

TO CONFIGURE SYNC WITH THE ORIGINAL SPOON-KNIFE:

1.On github go to the spoon-knife repo (original repo, the one you forked)
2.Click "clone or dowload" and copy URL
3.Open Terminal
4.Change the directories to the location of the fork you cloned in step 4 (first)
5.type "git remote -v" and press enter, you'll see the current configured remote repo for your fork like: "origin----(fetch) and origin-----(push)"
6.Type "git remote add upstream" and paste the URL from the original repo, press enter.
7.If you type again "git remote -v" you will see the upstream repo

TO ACTUALLY SYNC YOUR FORK WITH THE ORIGINAL SPOON-KNIFE:

1.Open terminal
2.Go to your local project's directory
3.Fetch the branches and their respective commits from the UPSTREAM repo. i.e. commits to master will be stored in a local branch: upstream/master. You do this by typing 
	"git fetch upstream"
4.Checkout your fork's local master branch with "git checkout master"
5.Merge the changes from upstream/master into your local master branch. This brings your fork's master branch into sync with the upstream repo WITHOUT LOSING YOUR LOCAL CHANGES, do this by typing 
	"git merge upstream/master"

done

git add . (or git add -a)
git commit -a -m "comment"
git push 
(if something was updated from the browser, you must type git pull)

git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
