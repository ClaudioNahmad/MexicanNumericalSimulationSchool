<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       readascii - read an ascii file


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>readascii</B> <I>filename</I>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>readascii</B>  is  a  command to read in the currently open ascii file and
       write it out in binary form into file <I>filename.</I>  The <B>ascii2binary</B> pro-
       gram  also  converts TIPSY ascii format into TIPSY binary format.  The
       <B>oldreadascii</B> command is used for ascii files with the old format.

       If no ascii file is open or if a binary file is already open an  error
       is  generated.   Ascii  files  are opened using the <B>openascii</B> command.
       After the binary file is written the ascii  file  is  closed  and  the
       binary  file <I>filename</I> is opened.  Binary files can be opened or closed
       using the <B>openbinary</B> and <B>closebinary</B> commands.

       The ascii file should be of the TIPSY ascii form  and  typically  con-
       tains all the time frames in sequential order.  Each time frame should
       be of the form:


              ntotal, ngas, nstar

              ndimensions

              time

              mass(i), i = 1 to ntotal

              x_position(i), i = 1 to ntotal

              y_position(i), i = 1 to ntotal

              z_position(i), i = 1 to ntotal

              x_velocity(i), i = 1 to ntotal

              y_velocity(i), i = 1 to ntotal

              z_velocity(i), i = 1 to ntotal

              grav_softening_length_dark_particles(i), i = 1 to ndark

              grav_softening_length_star_particles(i), i = 1 to nstar

              density(i), i = 1 to ngas

              temperature(i), i = 1 to ngas

              sph_smoothing_length(i), i = 1 to ngas,

              metals_gas(i), i = 1 to ngas,

              metals_star(i), i = 1 to nstar,

              formation_time(i), i = 1 to nstar,

              potential_energy(i), i = 1 to ntotal,

       where ntotal is the total number of particles, ngas is the  number  of
       gas particles, ndark is the number of dark matter particles, and nstar
       is the number of star particles.  The first ngas particles  should  be
       the gas particles and the last nstar particles should be the star par-
       ticles with the dark particles being in the middle.   Therefore,  each
       time frame should contain 9*ntotal+3*ngas+2nstar +3 lines.

       After  the  binary  file  is made a specific time must still be loaded
       using the <B>loadbinary</B> command.
