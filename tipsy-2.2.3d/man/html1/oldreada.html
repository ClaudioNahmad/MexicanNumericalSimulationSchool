<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       oldreadascii - read an old format ascii file


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>oldreadascii</B> <I>filename</I> <I>type</I>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>oldreadascii</B>  is a command to read in the currently open ascii file if
       it is in the old ascii format and write it out  in  binary  form  into
       file <I>filename.</I>  This command only exists to preserve backwards compat-
       ibility.  The <B>readascii</B> command is used for ascii files with the usual
       format.   If no ascii file is open or if a binary file is already open
       an error is generated.  Ascii files are  opened  using  the  <B>openascii</B>
       command  and  binary  files  are closed using the <B>closebinary</B> command.
       After the binary file is written the ascii  file  is  closed  and  the
       binary file <I>file-name</I> is opened.  After the binary file is made a spe-
       cific time must still be loaded using the  <B>loadbinary</B>  command  before
       any plotting can be done.

       The  ascii  file  should  be of the old ascii form and contain all the
       time frames in sequential order.  If  <I>type</I>  is  <B>sph</B>  each  time  frame
       should be of the form:


              ntotal, ndimensions, time, ngas, nstar

              mass(i), i = 1 to ntotal

              x_position(i), i = 1 to ntotal

              y_position(i), i = 1 to ntotal

              z_position(i), i = 1 to ntotal

              x_velocity(i), i = 1 to ntotal

              y_velocity(i), i = 1 to ntotal

              z_velocity(i), i = 1 to ntotal

              density(i), i = 1 to ngas

              temperature(i), i = 1 to ngas

              sph_smoothing_length(i), i = 1 to ngas,
       where  ntotal  is the total number of particles, ngas is the number of
       gas particles, and nstar is the number of star particles.   The  first
       ngas  particles  should be the gas particles and the last nstar parti-
       cles should be the star particles with the dark particles being in the
       middle.  If <I>type</I> is <B>nosph</B> each time frame should be of the form:


              ntotal, ndimensions, time

              mass(i), i = 1 to ntotal

              x_position(i), i = 1 to ntotal

              y_position(i), i = 1 to ntotal

              z_position(i), i = 1 to ntotal

              x_velocity(i), i = 1 to ntotal

              y_velocity(i), i = 1 to ntotal

              z_velocity(i), i = 1 to ntotal.
