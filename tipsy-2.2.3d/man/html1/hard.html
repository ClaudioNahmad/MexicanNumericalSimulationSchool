<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       hard - make an X window dump (and send it to the printer)


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>hard</B> <I>filename</I>


</PRE>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>hard</B> redraws the current plot full screen size and writes a xwd format
       file of the image into the file <I>filename</I> so that it can be sent  to  a
       color printer or displayed again later.  The image is written when any
       mouse button is pressed.  Carefully center the  image  on  the  screen
       before  pressing  a mouse button because what you see is what you get.
       If nothing is currently plotted an error will be generated.  There are
       a few special <I>filenames</I> that cause the command to behave slightly dif-
       ferently.

       If the <I>filename</I>  is  <B>''print''</B>  no  file  is  written  but  instead  a
       postscript  file is sent to the default printer to be printed in black
       and white.

       If the <I>filename</I> is <B>''colorprint''</B> no file is  written  but  instead  a
       color  postscript file is sent to the default printer to be printed in
       color.

       If the <I>filename</I> is <B>''photo''</B> no file is written and the image  remains
       on  the screen until a button is pressed.  This command is useful when
       taking pictures of the images.

       If the <I>filename</I> is <B>''movie''</B> a file is written to file  <I>filename</I>  that
       contains the image in the current window but with the same size as the
       current window.  Also, the command does not wait for a mouse button to
       be  pressed  to  write the file.  It is important to make certain that
       the entire view area is uncovered when using this option because  what
       you see is what you get.  This command is useful for making movies.

       If  the <I>filename</I> is <B>''dump''</B> an image is written to the file <I>filename.</I>
       The image contains the contents of the backing pixmap which tipsy uses
       to refresh the current window.  This is useful if the window is larger
       than the display.
