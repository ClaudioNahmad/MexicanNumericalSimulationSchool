<H2>NAME</H2><PRE>
       makebox - make and load a box interactively


</PRE>
<H2>SYNOPSIS</H2><PRE>
       <B>makebox</B> <I>box-number</I>


</PRE>
<H2>ALIASES</H2><PRE>
       <B>mbox</B>

<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>makebox</B>  is  used  to define the boundaries of box <I>box-number</I> interac-
       tively and then load that box. The requested box must be between 1 and
       <I>MAXBOX</I>  or  an  error  will  be generated.  The value of <I>MAXBOX</I> can be
       found by using the <B>version</B> command.  If the currently plotted  box  is
       not  the  currently  active  box,  or  if  the internal state has been
       altered since the last plot an error is generated.

       Once the command is executed a pointer will appear on  the  view  sur-
       face.     Click the left mouse button while holding down the shift key
       at the desired location of the lower left hand corner of box  <I>box-num-</I>
       <I>ber.</I>   This  fixes  the  lower  left  hand  corner of the box.  As the
       pointer is moved using the mouse, the outline of the box is plotted in
       green.  Once the pointer is at the desired location of the upper right
       hand corner of the box, again click the left mouse button while  hold-
       ing down the shift key.  The image is then rotated down 90 degrees and
       redisplayed so that the other two edges of the  box  can  be  defined.
       The  green line shows the projected edge of the box that was just pre-
       viously defined.  Press the left mouse button while holding  down  the
       shift  key at the desired bottom edge and press it again while holding
       down the shift key at the desired top edge.

       Remember, during the whole operation of the <B>makebox</B> command, the mouse
       keys perform their normal functions: zoom, unzoom, and pan.  These can
       be used to aid the construction of the box.  Only if the shift key  is
       held  down  while pressing the left mouse button will the <B>makebox</B> com-
       mand record the position.  If the shift key isn't held down the  image
       will  just  be  zoomed as per usual.  Once a box is made and loaded it
       still isn't the active box for plotting until the <B>activatebox</B>  command
       is used.  Boxes are removed using the <B>unload</B> command.

       Boxes  can also be made and loaded using the <B>setbox</B> and <B>setsphere</B> com-
       mands.  Box 0 can also be made and loaded using the  <B>loadall</B>  command.
       Boxes can be plotted using the <B>showboxes</B> command.
