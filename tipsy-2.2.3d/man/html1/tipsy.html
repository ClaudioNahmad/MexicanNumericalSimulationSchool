<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The developement of TIPSY was motivated by the need to quickly display
       and analyze the results of N-body simulations.  Most  data  visualiza-
       tion  packages are designed for the display of gridded data, and hence
       are unsuitable for use with particle data.  Therefore, a special pack-
       age was built that could easily perform the following functions:

       * Display particle positions (as points), and velocities (as line seg-
       ments) from an arbitrary viewpoint.

       * Zoom in to a chosen position.   Due  to  their  extremely  clustered
       nature,  structure  of  interest  in  an N-body simulation is often so
       small that it can not be seen when looking  at  the  simulation  as  a
       whole.

       *  Color  particles to display scalar fields.  Examples of such fields
       are potential energy, or for SPH particles, density and temperature.

       * Selection of a subset of the particles  for  display  and  analysis.
       Regions of interest are generally small subsets of the simulation.

       * Following selected particles from one timestep to another.

       *  Finding  cumulative properties of a collection of particles.   This
       usually involves just a sum over the particles.

       The basic data structure is an array of  particle  structures.   Since
       TIPSY  was  built  for use with cosmological N-body simulations, there
       are actually three separate arrays for each of the types  of  particle
       used  in such simulations: collisionless particles, SPH particles, and
       star particles.  A single timestep is read into these  arrays  from  a
       disk  file.  Display is done by finding the x and y coordinates of the
       particles in the  rotated  coordinate  system,  and  storing  them  in
       arrays.  Screen coordinates are calculated from these arrays according
       to the current zoom factor.  Also, a software Z-buffer  is  maintained
       to save time if many particles project to the same screen pixel.

       There are several types of display.  An ''all plot'' displays all par-
       ticles colored according to their type.  A ''radial plot'' will  color
       particles  according to the projection of the velocity along the line-
       of-sight.  A ''gas plot'' will color gas according to  SPH  quantities
       such as density, temperature, neutral hydrogen fraction, etc.

       Subsets  of particles are maintained using ''boxes''.  A box structure
       contains a bounding box, and an array of pointers to particles  within
       the  box.   All  display  and  analysis functions are performed on the
       ''active box''.  By default all particles are loaded into box 0, which
       becomes the active box.

       If  a  new  timestep  is  read  from disk, all boxes are destroyed.  A
       selection of  particles  can  be  followed  between  timesteps  via  a
       ''mark''  array.  Marked particles are displayed in a different color,
       and the analysis functions can be told to only operate on  the  marked
       particles.

       To quickly test out tipsy, try the commands:

       openascii run99.ascii

       readascii run99.bin

       loadb 14

       xall
