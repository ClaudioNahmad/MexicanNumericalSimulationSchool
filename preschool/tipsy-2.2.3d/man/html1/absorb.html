<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       <B>absorb</B> calculates absorption properties along a sight  line  specified
       by  <I>x</I> and <I>y.</I>  If <I>x</I> is the string "auto", then the sight line is deter-
       mined by a mouse click.  The properties calculated depend on the  <I>type</I>
       parameter which can be either "spectra", "column", "velocity", "dark",
       or "star".

       If  <I>type</I>  is  "dark"  or  "star"  then  <I>filename</I>  will  contain   <I>spa-</I>
       <I>tial</I><B>_</B><I>bin</I><B>_</B><I>number</I>  lines corresponding to spatial bins along the line of
       sight equally spaced across the active box.  Each  line  contains  the
       line of sight distance to the center of the bin, the mean mass density
       of "star" or "dark" (in gm/cc), the mean velocity of the  material  in
       that bin (in physical km/s, that is with Hubble flow included for cos-
       mological simulations), and the effective spatial resolution  used  in
       determining  the  density.  The density is determined in the following
       way.  For each particle, it is determined whether the  line  of  sight
       intersects the smoothing kernel (as set by the <B>smooth</B> command), and if
       it does the contribution of the spline kernel to the column density of
       each  bin  which  overlaps  the kernel is integrated along the line of
       sight.  The mass density for each  bin  is  then  the  column  density
       divided  by  the bin length, the velocity is the mass weighted veloci-
       ties (shifted by a Hubble term for cosmological  simulations)  of  the
       particles that contribute to the column density, and the resolution is
       the mass weighted smoothing lengths ("h" of the spline kernel).

       If <I>type</I> is "column" then <I>filename.col</I> will contain  <I>spatial</I><B>_</B><I>bin</I><B>_</B><I>number</I>
       lines as above with each line containing the line of sight distance to
       the bin, the total gas mass density, the mass weighted  velocity,  the
       mass weighted temperature, the mass density in HI, the velocity of the
       HI, the temperature of the HI, the mass density, velocity and tempera-
       ture  of  the  HeI,  the mass density, velocity and temperature of the
       HeII, the effective resolution, and an estimate of the  divergence  of
       the velocity.

       If  <I>type</I>  is  "velocity" then <I>filename.vel</I> will contain <I>vel</I><B>_</B><I>bin</I><B>_</B><I>number</I>
       lines corresponding  to  equally  spaced  velocity  intervals  between
       <I>vel</I><B>_</B><I>min</I>  and  <I>vel</I><B>_</B><I>max.</I>  Each line contains the central velocity of the
       bin, the column density per velocity interval of  HI  (in  gm/cm2  per
       km/s), the total column density of gas (in atoms/cm2/(km/s)), the neu-
       tral fraction of the gas  that  contributes  to  the  HI  column  den-
       sity(??),  the  mean  temperature of the HI gas, the density of the HI
       gas (in atoms/cc), the effective resolution of the HI, the  mean  tem-
       perature  of  the  total gas, the mean temperature squared of the gas,
       and the divergence of the velocity of the gas.  The  column  densities
       are  determined in the following way.  Each spatial bin along the line
       of sight is divided into 10 (a compile time  constant  "SUBBIN")  sub-
       bins.   The  velocity  and  temperature of these sub-bins are linearly
       interpolated from the adjacent bins.  A velocity profile is determined
       for  the  gas  in this sub-bin based on thermal broadening and damping
       wings.  This profile is then integrated  over  each  velocity  bin  to
       determine its contribution to the bin.

       If  <I>type</I> is "spectra", "column", or "velocity" then <I>filename</I> will con-
       tain <I>vel</I><B>_</B><I>bin</I><B>_</B><I>number</I> lines corresponding  to  equally  spaced  velocity
       intervals between <I>vel</I><B>_</B><I>min</I> and <I>vel</I><B>_</B><I>max.</I>  Each line contains the central
       velocity of the bin, the optical depth to HI absorption,  the  optical
       depth  to  HeI  absorption,  the optical depth to HeII absorption, the
       total optical depth to HI within the velocity interval (no line broad-
       ening), and the optical depth to deuterium absorption,
