       aabbssoorrbb calculates absorption properties along a sight line specified by
       _x  and _y_.  If _x is the string "auto", then the sight line is determined
       by a mouse click.  The properties calculated depend on the _t_y_p_e parame-
       ter  which  can  be  either "spectra", "column", "velocity", "dark", or
       "star".

       If _t_y_p_e is "dark" or "star" then _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e will contain _s_p_a_t_i_a_l___b_i_n___n_u_m_-
       _b_e_r lines corresponding to spatial bins along the line of sight equally
       spaced across the active box.  Each line contains  the  line  of  sight
       distance  to  the center of the bin, the mean mass density of "star" or
       "dark" (in gm/cc), the mean velocity of the material in  that  bin  (in
       physical km/s, that is with Hubble flow included for cosmological simu-
       lations), and the effective spatial resolution used in determining  the
       density.   The  density  is  determined in the following way.  For each
       particle, it is determined whether the line  of  sight  intersects  the
       smoothing  kernel  (as  set  by the ssmmooootthh command), and if it does the
       contribution of the spline kernel to the column  density  of  each  bin
       which  overlaps  the kernel is integrated along the line of sight.  The
       mass density for each bin is then the column density divided by the bin
       length, the velocity is the mass weighted velocities (shifted by a Hub-
       ble term for cosmological simulations) of the particles that contribute
       to  the column density, and the resolution is the mass weighted smooth-
       ing lengths ("h" of the spline kernel).

       If _t_y_p_e is "column" then _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e_._c_o_l will  contain  _s_p_a_t_i_a_l___b_i_n___n_u_m_b_e_r
       lines  as above with each line containing the line of sight distance to
       the bin, the total gas mass density, the mass  weighted  velocity,  the
       mass  weighted temperature, the mass density in HI, the velocity of the
       HI, the temperature of the HI, the mass density, velocity and  tempera-
       ture  of  the  HeI,  the  mass density, velocity and temperature of the
       HeII, the effective resolution, and an estimate of  the  divergence  of
       the velocity.

       If  _t_y_p_e  is  "velocity"  then _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e_._v_e_l will contain _v_e_l___b_i_n___n_u_m_b_e_r
       lines  corresponding  to  equally  spaced  velocity  intervals  between
       _v_e_l___m_i_n  and  _v_e_l___m_a_x_.   Each line contains the central velocity of the
       bin, the column density per velocity interval  of  HI  (in  gm/cm2  per
       km/s),  the total column density of gas (in atoms/cm2/(km/s)), the neu-
       tral fraction of the gas that contributes to the HI column density(??),
       the  mean  temperature  of  the  HI  gas, the density of the HI gas (in
       atoms/cc), the effective resolution of the HI, the mean temperature  of
       the  total gas, the mean temperature squared of the gas, and the diver-
       gence of the velocity of the gas.  The column densities are  determined
       in  the  following  way.   Each  spatial bin along the line of sight is
       divided into 10 (a  compile  time  constant  "SUBBIN")  sub-bins.   The
       velocity  and  temperature  of these sub-bins are linearly interpolated
       from the adjacent bins.  A velocity profile is determined for  the  gas
       in  this  sub-bin  based on thermal broadening and damping wings.  This
       profile is then integrated over each velocity bin to determine its con-
       tribution to the bin.

       If  _t_y_p_e  is "spectra", "column", or "velocity" then _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e will con-
       tain _v_e_l___b_i_n___n_u_m_b_e_r lines  corresponding  to  equally  spaced  velocity
       intervals  between _v_e_l___m_i_n and _v_e_l___m_a_x_.  Each line contains the central
       velocity of the bin, the optical depth to HI absorption,   the  optical
       depth  to  HeI  absorption,  the  optical depth to HeII absorption, the
       total optical depth to HI within the velocity interval (no line  broad-
       ening), and the optical depth to deuterium absorption,
