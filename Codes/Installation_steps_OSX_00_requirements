NagBody: Installation steps details (tested for Yosemite in 2016-09-25)


REQUIREMENTS:

1. Xcode (check it is installed and working):
Download the latest version of Xcode from the Apple developer website or get it using the Mac App Store.

Once you have Xcode installed, open a terminal, run xcode-select --install, and click the Install button to install the required command line developer tools. Don't worry if you see a message telling you the software cannot be installed because it is not currently available from the Software Update Server. This usually means you already have the latest version installed. You can also get the command line tools from the Apple developer website.

2. Terminal (check it is installed and working, normally is in Applications/Utilities)

3. Check that you have a working version of gcc.

4. Mac Ports Install (It dependes on the version)
If you are using OS X, you should install MacPorts using the OS X package installer unless you do not wish to install it to /opt/local/, the default MacPorts location.

The OS X package installer automatically installs MacPorts, sets the shell environment, and runs a selfupdate operation to update the ports tree and MacPorts base with the latest release.

Download the latest MacPorts-2.3.4-....pkg installer from the MacPorts download directory. 

Double-click the downloaded package installer to perform the default “easy” install.

After this step you are done already, MacPorts is now installed and your shell environment was set up automatically by the installer. To confirm the installation is working as expected, now try using port in a new terminal window.

$ port version
Version: 2.3.4
In case of problems such as “command not found”, make sure that you opened a new terminal window or consult Section 2.5, “MacPorts and the Shell”. Otherwise, please skip the remainder of this chapter and continue with Chapter 3, Using MacPorts in this guide.


5. Install new versions of gcc gcc++ and gfortran:
sudo port install gcc49 +gfortran
cd /opt/local/bin
sudo ln -s gfortran-mp-4.9 gfortran
cd

The last command is very important. Then you are in $HOME.


6. Install XQuartz (https://www.xquartz.org) to have X11 Windows.

7. Install gnuplot
sudo port install gnuplot

Test it:

gnuplot
set terminal x11
plot sin(x)

(If Xquartz does not run, go to Applications/Utilities and hit the icon, it opens a terminal and there run gnuplot)


8. Install plplot510
sudo port install plplot510

9. Install gsl
sudo port install gsl
